API with bus schedules from Juiz de Fora - MG

#### What do I have to do?

- `yarn` or `npm install`
- `yarn start` or `npm start`
- Now the API is up and running on port `3000`

The API is not finished but it does the most important things:

- It has a database (a json file, not good but...);
- Search route by number or name;
- Search route by id;
